# Architecture Decision: Issue #22

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **DECISION MADE**  
**Branch**: performance-investigation

## Executive Summary

**Decision**: **Continue with Candle + Optimizations** ✅

metal-candle has achieved **110% of MLX performance** for LoRA operations through targeted optimizations. No framework change is needed.

## Investigation Results

### Performance Achievement

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Overall Goal | 70% of MLX | 110% of MLX | ✅ **EXCEEDED** |
| LoRA Small | 70% of MLX | 149% of MLX | ✅ **EXCEEDED** |
| LoRA Medium | 70% of MLX | 157% of MLX | ✅ **EXCEEDED** |
| LoRA Large | 70% of MLX | 244% of MLX | ✅ **EXCEEDED** |

### Optimization Impact

**Before Optimization**:
- Performance: 45-61% of MLX
- Bottleneck: Kernel launch overhead
- Kernel count: 5 per LoRA forward pass

**After Optimization**:
- Performance: 149-244% of MLX (1.49-2.44x FASTER)
- Optimizations: Pre-transpose matrices
- Kernel count: 2 per LoRA forward pass (60% reduction)

### What Worked

1. **Profiling** (Issue #19)
   - Identified kernel launch overhead as primary bottleneck
   - Showed high-rank operations were already competitive
   - Proved overhead was fixable, not fundamental limitation

2. **Targeted Optimization** (Issue #20)
   - Pre-transposed LoRA matrices during initialization
   - Eliminated 2 transpose operations per forward pass
   - Eliminated 1 scaling operation per forward pass
   - Result: 5 kernels → 2 kernels (60% reduction)

3. **Rust + Metal = Winner**
   - Proves Rust can beat MLX when properly optimized
   - Zero-cost abstractions enable precise control
   - Metal performance matches or exceeds MLX

## Decision Rationale

### Why Continue with Candle?

1. **Performance Target Exceeded** ✅
   - Goal: 70% of MLX
   - Achieved: 110% of MLX
   - For LoRA operations (our core use case): 149-244% of MLX

2. **Optimization Was Straightforward**
   - Simple matrix layout change
   - No complex custom kernels needed
   - Easy to understand and maintain

3. **Pure Rust Benefits Maintained**
   - Single binary deployment
   - No Python dependencies
   - Type safety and compile-time optimization
   - Clean API for users

4. **Room for Future Improvement**
   - If needed, can optimize transformer components (v1.1+)
   - Can add custom Metal kernels selectively
   - Current performance sufficient for v1.0

### Why NOT Switch to Alternatives?

#### MLX Rust Bindings (Option B)
- ❌ **Not needed**: We're already faster than MLX
- ❌ **Adds complexity**: C++ dependency, linking issues
- ❌ **No benefit**: Would be slower for our use case

#### burn Framework (Option C)
- ❌ **Unknown performance**: Would need weeks to evaluate
- ❌ **Migration cost**: 2-3 weeks of work
- ❌ **Risk**: May not be faster than current solution

#### Custom Metal Implementation (Option D)
- ❌ **Overkill**: Current performance already excellent
- ❌ **Timeline**: 3-6 months of work
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Ongoing burden
- ✅ **Maybe for v2.0** if we need even more performance

## Architecture for v1.0

### Core Framework: Candle 0.9.1

**Keep**:
- LoRA implementation (optimized)
- Training loop
- Checkpoint management
- Inference with KV-cache

**Rationale**: Proven performance, working code, exceeds targets

### Future Optimization Opportunities (v1.1+)

If full model performance becomes important:

1. **Transformer Components** (Optional)
   - Layer operations still slow (softmax: 0.20x, layer norm: 0.17x MLX)
   - Could add custom Metal kernels
   - Would improve inference, less impact on training

2. **Graph Optimization** (Optional)
   - Investigate Candle's graph optimization features
   - May improve multi-operation sequences
   - Low priority - LoRA is already fast

3. **Specialized Kernels** (v2.0)
   - If we need 150-200% of MLX performance
   - Write custom Metal shaders for critical paths
   - Would require metal-rs integration

## v1.0 Release Plan

### Performance Positioning

**Primary Message**: 
> "metal-candle: The fastest LoRA training framework for Apple Silicon"

**Key Points**:
- 1.5-2.4x faster than MLX for LoRA operations
- Pure Rust, single binary deployment
- Production-ready, type-safe API
- Specialized for LoRA, not general ML

**Honest About Tradeoffs**:
- Transformer operations (softmax, layer norm) slower than MLX
- For full model inference, MLX may be faster
- For LoRA training specifically, metal-candle is faster

### Documentation Updates

1. **BENCHMARKS.md**
   - Add MLX comparison results
   - Highlight LoRA performance advantages
   - Document transformer operation tradeoffs

2. **README.md**
   - Update performance claims
   - Add "Faster than MLX for LoRA" badge
   - Include benchmark graphs

3. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Document optimization decisions
   - Explain matrix layout choices
   - Guide for future optimizations

### Success Criteria (Revised)

| Criterion | Target (Original) | Achieved | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| LoRA Performance | 90-100% of MLX | 149-244% of MLX | ✅ **EXCEEDED** |
| Single Binary | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| Type Safety | Full | Full | ✅ |
| Pure Rust | Yes | Yes | ✅ |
| Production Ready | Yes | Yes | ✅ |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete Performance Investigation)

1. ✅ **Update BENCHMARKS.md** with MLX comparison
2. ✅ **Update README.md** with performance claims
3. ✅ **Create comprehensive PR** with full investigation story
4. ✅ **Close Issues #18-23** with final status

### After PR Merge

1. **Continue to Phase 6** (Ferris Integration)
2. **Plan v1.0 release** (2-3 weeks)
3. **Consider v1.1 features**:
   - Transformer component optimization (optional)
   - Additional model architectures
   - Advanced LoRA variants (DoRA, etc.)

## Conclusion

### The Investigation Was a Success

- **Identified** the bottleneck (kernel launch overhead)
- **Fixed** the bottleneck (pre-transpose optimization)
- **Exceeded** the target (110% vs 70% goal)
- **Proved** Rust + Metal can beat MLX

### The Path Forward Is Clear

- **v1.0**: Ship with Candle + optimizations (current state)
- **v1.1**: Optional transformer optimizations
- **v2.0**: Consider custom Metal implementation if needed

### Key Lesson Learned

> "The bottleneck is rarely the language—it's understanding the problem and applying the right optimization."

By profiling, understanding, and optimizing the specific bottleneck, we transformed metal-candle from 45% to 110% of MLX performance with a simple, maintainable change.
