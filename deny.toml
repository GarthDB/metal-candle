[advisories]
# Ignore specific advisories (with justification)
ignore = [
    # Unmaintained crates (not security issues)
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0119",  # number_prefix - unmaintained but functional (via hf-hub → indicatif)
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0436",  # paste - archived but functional (via candle-core → gemm/metal)
]

# Note on ignored advisories:
# - Both are transitive dependencies from major crates (Candle, HuggingFace)
# - These are maintenance advisories, NOT security vulnerabilities
# - The crates still function correctly
# - Will be resolved when upstream dependencies update
# - Monitored for updates in each release
